# Gift-of-the-Givers Foundation

# Description
This project builds a web app for the Gift-of-the-Givers Foundation to manage disaster relief. Volunteers can sign up, resources and donations are tracked, and reports ensure aid reaches the right places. 
Iâ€™m using Azure Boards for project work and Azure SQL Database for secure data.
